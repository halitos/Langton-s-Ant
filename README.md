# Langton's Ant

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton's_ant

Langton's Ant is a cellular automaton that moves around a two-dimensional grid of black and white cells. The ant can face one of four different directions - north, south, east or west. At each step of the simulation the ant will decide where to move - if the ant is currently on a black cell then it turns 90 degrees to the right and moves forward one cell . Similarly, if the ant is on a white cell then it turns 90 degrees to the left and moves forward one cell. Whenever the ant leaves a cell, it inverts the colour of that cell

## About

Deployed to Vercel: https://langton-s-ant.vercel.app/

- The canvas solution works per pixel.
  The ant moves in 2D array grid, with x-y coordinates and invert each pixel's fillStyle.

- The Antman solution made with Vue JS
  Similar 2D array used to create grids with id names of 'x,y'
  Antman moves based on toggled classes
